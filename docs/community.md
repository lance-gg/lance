We make great efforts to maintain an active, positive, friendly and inclusive community around Incheon and game development.

### Starting out

To get a bird's eye view on how what's Incheon all about and how to use it to make a multiplayer game, we recommend reading the {@tutorial guide}

If you're more of the learning-by-doing type, you can start with the first tutorial, [My first game: Pong](http://docs.incheon.gg/develop/tutorial-MyFirstGame.html) which contains step-by-step instructions on how to implement a networked version of this classic game.

### Joining the discussion
You're welcome to join the [Incehon Slack](http://slack.incheon.gg) to hang out and engage in active discussion with the project maintainers and fellow game developers.

### Keeping in touch

Follow [IncheonGG](http://twitter.com/IncheonGG) on Twitter to hear the latest and see what others are doing with Incheon

### Getting help
Feel free to ask anything on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/incheon). We keep an eye out for questions!

### Helping out

Incheon is an open source project, and as such we welcome any contribution.

 * Spreading the word, posting or tweeting about Incheon in social media using the @incheongg tag. The larger the community, the more fun we have and the faster development can move!

 * Improving the documentation: fixing typos, expanding, clarifying or writing new articles

 * Fixing bugs, or adding new functionality. A good place to start would be issues on Github with a status of **["PR Welcome"](https://github.com/OpherV/Incheon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PR+welcome%22)**. Make sure to open pull requests against the develop branch.
